## 👨🏾‍💻 Cybersecurity Professional 👨🏾‍💻 

I'm a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) operations. My expertise includes ethical hacking, SIEM implementation, vulnerability management, threat detection, and identity & access management (IAM).  
I focus on securing systems through proactive risk mitigation, least privilege enforcement, and continuous security monitoring.

Explore my projects below to see how I break, test, and secure systems to enhance real-world cyber resilience!
