  ## 👨🏾‍💻 Cybersecurity Professional 👨🏾‍💻 

I’m a cybersecurity professional with hands-on experience in both offensive (Red Team) and defensive (Blue Team) operations. My expertise spans ethical hacking, SIEM implementations, vulnerability management, threat detection, and identity & access management (IAM). I focus on securing systems through proactive risk mitigation, least privilege enforcement, and continuous security monitoring.
